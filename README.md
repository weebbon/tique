			* Design of t-shirts (with/without back print?)
		* Pro-one paint color
		* Desired profit
			* Print this quotation
		* Host's profit
		* Collaterals (free)
		* Social media management (free)
		* Let's get started (e-mail to host)

	* Organization information
		* Organization Name
		* Contact Details
			* Mobile
			* E-mail
			* Landline
		* Representative's Name
		* 140-char description of org mission.

	* Physical/Online?
		* Physical (Where do you plan to sell the items?)

	* Your target audience

Basically a self-serving quotation form that a user can fill-in and submit to the host businesse's e-mail for initial infos and initial review.
